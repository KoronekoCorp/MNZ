        [02:44.220] Round and round we go
        [02:47.277] Holding on to pain
        [02:49.976] Driven by our egos
        [02:52.965] Feelings untold
        [02:56.342] Spinning our own versions of the past
        [03:02.015] That you could never know
        [03:04.548]
        [03:04.671] How would I know?
        [03:06.925] I could be the reason why
        [03:10.762] You were able to be kind
        [03:13.773] And the hearts we held so tight won't stay broken
        [03:19.120] Love must be the reason why
        [03:22.943] I still believe in this lie
        [03:25.914] That you'll live a better life without me by your side
        [03:32.084]

        [00:16.696]Say my name when a tree susurrates
        [00:27.845]Once and again telling a story lost in time
        [00:33.729]the way it starts and the way it ends
        [00:39.843]Never again making up stories in dismay
        [00:45.705]With several starts, but just one end
        [00:51.823]
        [00:52.617]Ah, how I long to embrace
        [01:03.538]The future breaking out of shades from the past
        [01:13.602]Still ablaze
        [01:16.789]
        [01:22.647]Save your tears for the day so far away
        [01:33.789]To irrigate the wilderness that’s still asleep
        [01:39.902]In the world waiting to be lit
        [01:45.771]To spread over the riverbeds so dry and dead
        [01:51.601]Let ships that ran aground re-launch their sails
        [01:57.977]
        [01:58.790]Ah, how I long to embrace
        [02:09.428]The future breaking out of shades from the past

        [02:38.419]
        [02:39.216]Petals linger about
        [02:44.268]awaiting one last dance
        [02:49.845]Shaking off all the dust from the past
        [02:56.220]New stories have yet to start

        [00:16.696]当花叶呢喃之时，请呼唤我的名字
        [00:27.845]由此开启那飘零于时间里的故事
