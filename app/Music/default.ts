        [00:13.535]飞呀，破碎的翅膀
        [00:16.009]我知道你仍在我身旁
        [00:21.355]只需你轻轻一推，我就能再次起飞
        [00:26.760]飞呀，破碎的翅膀
        [00:29.261]带我前往自由之地
        [00:33.404]接近我们的“理想”
        [00:37.750]
        [00:43.535]湿润的双眼
        [00:46.330]曾经温柔的某人
        [00:49.759]我旁观逐渐腐朽不见的你
        [00:54.828]镜子说
        [00:58.081]我并未忘记希望
        [01:09.216]能做你喜欢做的事
        [01:07.650]
        [01:12.167]难道还不够吗？难道还不够吗？
        [01:14.907]拥有天生的才能，完美的职位
        [01:17.232]难道还不够吗？难道还不够吗？
        [01:19.995]一次又一次
        [01:21.192]你束缚了我，我束缚了我
        [01:23.675]我们一同把我钉在地上
        [01:31.698]土壤温暖我的身体
        [01:26.323]
        [01:42.562]永眠吧，渺小的梦想
        [01:39.221]
        [01:45.927]来杀尽我心中那朵朵山茶花呀
        [01:51.495]若能放弃，有多容易？
        [01:56.826]为何这双不听话的手非要伸向那些过于遥远的梦？
        [02:03.334]憧憬普通的我这份饥渴是否“异常”？
        [02:10.029]飞呀，完美的翅膀
        [02:09.434]
        [02:10.954]（再见，再见，再见）
        [02:12.638]你至今为止到底藏在哪里？
        [02:13.914]（再见，再见，再见）
        [02:16.604]带我回到我们最初始的那个心境
        [02:23.375]飞呀，完美的翅膀
        [02:23.971]（再见，再见，再见）
        [02:25.874]为大家展现我的实力
        [02:27.397]（再见，再见，再见）
        [02:29.972]一次就够，还请帮我实现
        [02:36.408]“以上”就是我最后的愿望

        [00:13.535] Fly, broken wings
        [00:16.009] I know you are still with me
        [00:21.355] All I need is a nudge to get me started
        [00:26.760] Fly, broken wings
        [00:29.261] To somewhere we can free
        [00:33.404] Closer to our "IDEAL"
        [00:37.750]
        [00:43.535] Teary eyed
        [00:46.330] Once-gentle soul
        [00:49.759] I watched as you rotted away
        [00:54.828] The mirror says
        [00:58.081] That I still remember hope
        [01:03.426] Mmm
        [01:07.650]
        [01:09.216] You're doing what you love
        [01:12.167] Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
        [01:14.907] A genius, perfect job
        [01:17.232] Isn't that enough? Isn't that enough?
        [01:19.995] Again and again
        [01:21.192] You locked me down, I locked me down
        [01:23.675] We staked me to the ground
        [01:26.323]
        [01:31.698] The soil gave me warmth
        [01:39.221]
        [01:42.562] Please die, little dreams
        [01:45.927] Kill the camellias in me
        [01:51.495] Wouldn't it be easier to give in?
        [01:56.826] Why are these hands chasing dreams out of my reach?
        [02:03.334] Is my thirst for normalcy "ODD"?
        [02:09.434]
        [02:10.029] Fly, perfect wings
        [02:10.954] (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
        [02:12.638] Where have you been hiding?
        [02:13.914] (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
        [02:16.604] Bring me to the mind that got us started
        [02:23.375] Fly, perfect wings
        [02:23.971] (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
        [02:25.874] Show them who I can be
        [02:27.397] (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)
        [02:29.972] For the one last time, if you will
        [02:36.408] "THAT'S ALL"

        [01:19.225] I cursed this relationship between you and me
        [01:26.252]
